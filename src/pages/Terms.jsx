                                    adjust your quote unless we are provided with inaccurate information or
                                    your item arrives damaged. We will get all the details, including
                                    specifications, condition, photos, and serial number, in order to confirm
                                    your quote prior to you shipping us your item(s).

                                    <strong>PRICING.</strong> SellYourMac reserves the right to adjust pricing
                                    if the item received differs in terms of specifications or condition from
                                    the “quote”. If the item is tested and is found to not work as described
                                    in the quote, or arrives broken or with water damage, we will email you
                                    with a new quote to reflect the item received. It is your responsibility
                                    as the customer to accurately represent the device you wish to sell.

                                    <strong>REVISED QUOTE POLICY.</strong> If the item(s) you send to us do
                                    not match the condition or specifications you provided at the time of your
                                    original quote, we reserve the right to issue a Revised Quote based on the
                                    actual condition and current market value of the item(s) upon
                                    inspection.<br /><br />
                                    You will be notified of any Revised Quote via the contact information you
                                    provided during checkout (such as email or SMS). Upon receiving the
                                    Revised Quote, you will have 14 calendar days to either accept or reject
                                    the offer.<br /><br />
                                    If we do not receive a response from you within 14 days, the Revised Quote
                                    will be automatically accepted, and we will proceed with processing your
                                    payment based on the revised amount. Once accepted—whether explicitly or
                                    automatically—the transaction is final, and the item(s) will not be
                                    returned.<br /><br />
                                    If you reject the Revised Quote within the 14-day window, we will return
                                    your item(s) upon request. Return shipping costs are the responsibility of
                                    the sender, and must be paid before the item is shipped back.

                                    arrive within 2 business days, after receiving an email containing a
                                    virtual code and instructions to redeem the virtual prepaid card. Check
                                    options are: via USPS standard 1st class mail (3–15 business days, free),
                                    USPS Priority Mail (2–3 business days, $10 fee), and Overnight shipping (1

                                    <strong>PACKING YOUR ITEM.</strong> SellYourMac is not responsible for you
                                    poorly packaging your item. If your package is damaged in transit, we can
                                    file an insurance claim, provided it was properly packed. If the item is
                                    poorly packed, however, the shipping company will not honor the claim and
                                    ultimately you are responsible. The condition of the item when it arrives
                                    at SellYourMac’s warehouse is your responsibility. Please take the time to
                                    learn how to pack your item or have it packed professionally.
