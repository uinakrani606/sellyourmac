Very easy to get a quote, they paid for the shipping of my items, and I feel secure in knowing that they wipe the computer clean. Not only that, but there was a potential issue with my computer where I would receive either $530 or $120. They could have easily said there was an issue and given me the lesser amount, but they performed their tests and I received the full $530. I definitely recommend if you plan on selling your mac."

I was so happy to find out that the display was something they could replace for my 4s and for a reasonable price! On top of that they had me in and out within the hour. While I was waiting, I was looking at some of the items they had for sale and was excited to see they had such great pricing. Also, I found to that all the staff that I encountered where super helpful and friendly. Sell Your Mac will not only be the first place that I go, but the only place."

We looked at the trade in programs at a retail store because they were local. The retail offer was too low. I checked online at a couple of sites and SYM beat all other offers by $100. I was nervous selling to any company I did not know. I checked the BBB website to confirm SYM was real and took the chance. Everything went great. I was fair in judging the condition of the laptop. I was worried that SYM may say that they found x and offer less money once they got the computer. This did not happen. I got the full amount of what was offered in the quote. Within 2 weeks of shipping the laptop, I had a check in the mail. To sum up: I got a honest transaction, a better price and a smooth process. Thank You. I will recommend you to others."

He has good people skills: making the effort to connect, helping us know more about the product, and having a sense of humor. We felt like we were being treated as valued customers, and that every effort was being taken to satisfy our needs. I've already told a friend about our experience and will be telling others.

            feedback: "Excited about the upcoming iPhone 5, I got an estimate from SellYourMac on my iPhone 4. It was so easy sending a few pictures and getting the prepaid envelope sent out. The turn around was very quick and I got my check in the mail 6 days after I shipped the phone off! Perfect timing to pay for my iPhone 5!! My husband was so impressed he is making me sell his 4S so he can upgrade as well. I would definitly recommend this to a friend!"

I got a promotional email through MacWorld for sellyourmac. I decided to try it. It was easy. Just took a few pictures of the iPhone and sent them in and I received a quote followed by a prepaid mailer. That was it. I received the quoted payment in the mail yesterday. No hassles at all. So our dust gathering iPhone was converted into cash. I was a little disappointed though as I also have a G5 PPC iMac that I would just as soon get rid of. Unfortunately, sellyourmac will no longer take PPC macs. But, I would definitely recommend this service to my friends and would also consider buying used mac/iOS equipment from their ebay site. Jim"
